# SemesterPractical
This is our semester practical for REII 313 2020. In this practical we will implement the Simplex method and Branch-and-Bound. The practical implementation must be written in c++ and a report  is expected where the design is presented in unified modeling language (UML). A graphical user interface (GUI) is required.
